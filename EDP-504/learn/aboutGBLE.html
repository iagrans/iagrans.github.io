		    <p>Almost every household in America has some sort of video game technology, whether it be mobile game, Wii Console, or a basic computer. The video game industry surpassed the movie industry in sales back in 2009. James Paul Gee, renouned literacy researcher and author of "<em>What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy</em>", poses an interesting question to this, &quot;How, in heaven's name, do they sell video games when they are so long and hard?<a href="#r1">[1]</a>&quot; No one plays games that they cannot learn, but if game designers make shorter and simpler games, then there is less challenge and gamers do not play those either.  So how do these designers keep players engaged and wanting to learn these long, diffulcut games? Scaffolding, goal setting, and fun. If we take a look at school, which is percieved by some as difficult or boring, we can see students dissengage when the content is too hard, and even if the content is manageable, it can quickly become rudiment and boring. Now when education and video games pair effectivly, it keep students engaged with challenging educational content while still having fun. </p>

    	<p>These Game Based Learning Environments, instead of teaching basic game mechanics like jumping or shooting, also teach educational game mechanics such as shooting only numbers that add up to a certain value as in Math Blasters. Games provide many affordances for teaching well defined problems (math, science, reading, etc.). Video games generally have built in tutorial systems or training options available. For example in Pokémon, Professor Oak teaches the young hero how to fight in his first battle, and explains different mechanics as they arise such as getting new items. These tutorials, or <strong>scaffolds</strong> if you will, fade out as the player gains more experience. Additionally, video games set goals for the player to accomplish, and the player typically has to complete a series of sub tasks before the goal can be completed. For many games, the tutorials are not seperate from the main game, and in fact provides strong background information,  such as in Portal <a href="#r2">[2]</a>. As mentioned earlier video games are inherently fun, but why is that? Many theories exist, but the most agreed upon characteristics are Challenge, Fantasy, and Curiosity. These happen to translate well to theories in educational psychology. </p>
	      <p>There are many learning theories catered to in educational video games<a href="#r3">[3]</a>.  Overcoming obstacles can be rewarding in itself, but rewarding the player in game is also a good idea.  It provides <strong>positive reinforcement</strong> of the desired behavior/task and lets players know they are correct. This can be done through in-game prizes or points, but also through valuable and immediate <strong>feedback</strong>. Educational video games allow for <strong>active learning</strong> in a <strong>situated learning environment</strong>, where students can learn through <strong>inductive discovery</strong> (trial-and-error) in a safe  setting.  Active learning is essentially learning by doing, and getting active participation by the learner. Situated learning is set in an environment that is similar or identical to where the learning material might be applied in the future. Creating highly realistic and immersive environments is something that games do particularly well. </p>

			<div class="headline"><h3>Applications in Practice</h3></div>
			<p>There are dozens of game based learning environments developed to teach a wide variety of topics such as buisness training, social awareness and causes [<a href="http://ecogamer.org/environmental-games" target="new">a</a>, <a href="http://www.peacemakergame.com" target="new">b</a>, <a href="http://www.peta.org/interactive/type/games/" target="new" onClick="alert('Peta games may not be suitable for young children');">c</a> ], health management for illnesses [<a href="http://www.re-mission2.org" target="new">d</a>, <a href="http://www.cilein.com/SymptomScenes/SymptomScenes.html" target="new">e</a>], and core curricula for k-12 education [<a href="http://ci-lostinvestigation.appspot.com" target="new">f</a>, <a href="http://g4li.org/?game=invasion-of-species" target="new">g</a>]. The game we will be highlighting here is Crsytal Island: Uncharted discovery, a game that teaches map skills (space-to-map & map-to-space relations)<a href="#r4">[4]</a>. </p>
			<p>CI: Uncharted Discovery is a geology themed game where when finished, the students should be able to identify common landforms, recognize how to represent them and other large human structures using models like maps, and that maps can be used to navigate in a 3D environment.  The storyline follows ship wrecked adventures who land on a nearby island. The player takes control of their character in the recently erected village and works through a tutorial mission introducing them to their character's abilities, the user interface, and the game controls. We can already see how this game might peak a students sense of curiosity and motivation for playing.  </p>

       	<p>Following the tutorial mission, the player is charged with completing a number of tasks in order to help establish life on the island. Tasks include identifying and documenting landforms and creating maps and models of the village. To complete the tasks, students are provided with several tools such as expert characters, a camera, a science notebook, and a map of the village.  </p>  
          <p>
            CI: Uncharted Discovery makes good use of the scaffoliding theory we mentioned up top. The student must complete several modeling tasks throughout the game.  The first quest asks the student to match a photo of the island with a corresponding model.  The next task has the student create the model themselves using a virtual tablet, In addition to these quests, the student’s problem-solving activities are scaffolded through several mechanisms. Her virtual tablet includes a reference app that provides multimedia presentations on topics about landforms, maps, and models. It also includes a problem-solving app and text message app among other things. The problem solving app specifically presents the player with dynamic support on a per-quest basis, by helping students work through the problem solving process (understand, plan, implement, and reflect).  The text messaging app is a non-intrusive way for students to receive timely help from the in game chacaters such a adivce on resources to use or where to go next.
          This is just one example of active learning through digital games.</p>

	  <h3>Controversies Surrounding GBLEs</h3></div>
			<p>One of the great things about educational games is that they allow students to actively learn,   explore, and recieve feedback about  concepts like anatomy or biology. These topics become much more approachable than reading from a text book and compensates for activities that would be too expensive or too dangerous to experience first-hand in traditional science classrooms.
			However, incorperating technology and learning haphazardly can be ineffective. And can sometimes even decrease a students understanding.</p>

            <p>
			Most controversy surrounding game based learning environments centers around the effectiveness of the actual systems. Sure students show signs of being more enaged with the game and staying relatively focused, but do the games actually increase learning gains.  A <a href="http://www.intellimedia.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/narrative-its-2008.pdf" target="new">2008 study <i class="icon-external-link-sign"></i></a> on  Crystal Island:Outbreak, which taught 8th grade microbiology, showed that students students who participated in the control group (power point) actually had higher learning gains from than the experimental group (game). Additionally, within the two game groups, the one with less narrative reported higher presence (a contributing factor towards motivation). Researchers hypothesize that students might have suffered from cognitive overload, and that the intial game had many avenues for off-task behavior.  In future iterations, the game had been modified to reduce cognitive load and to guide students with goal-oriented tasks (also removed unecessary game objects). Significant learning gains have been demonstrated <a href="http://www.intellimedia.ncsu.edu/?page_id=303" target="_blank">repeatdly <i class="icon-external-link-sign"></i></a> since then. </p>
