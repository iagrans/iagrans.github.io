				<h2>Directions</h2>
				<p>The first part of our study is a pre-survey to gauge your incoming skills and experience with the Beauty and Joy of Computing course.  Then, we will ask you read through three programming lab descriptions and rank three sample assignments for each lab from best to worst. You will then complete an activity to learn about our new computational thinking-based rubrics, and then use them to grade three sample assignments for each of three additional labs.  <p>
				<p>Once you have completed the pre-survey, you may move on to the next page.</p>
