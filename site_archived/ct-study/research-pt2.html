				<p>Below we've listed the learning objectives that our researchers in collaboration with field experts have voted on as pertaining to these labs. We encourage you to identify which learning objectives are covered in each of the projects.</p>

				<p>Here is a sample rubric we have developed using the appropriate learning objectives to help aid in evaluating student progress. The rubrics also help in identifying the elements of computational thinking in student code in addtion to providing a consistent form of evaluation.</p>

					<thead><tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>CATEGORY</th><th>4</th><th>3</th><th>2</th><th>1</th><th>0</th><th>Learning Objective/Essential Knowledge</th></tr></thead>
					<tbody>
					 <tr><td>Abstraction</td><td>EK 2.2.1C An abstraction generalizes functionality with input parameters that allow software reuse.</td><td>Code properly separated into multiple abstractions. Should have separate blocks defined.</td><td>Code separated into multiple abstractions with only minor overlapping between functions. </td><td>Code separated into multiple abstractions with functions that do the same thing. </td><td>Little of the code is properly abstracted with the majority of functions left together.</td><td>Code all contained within one singular block, not separated into more blocks and functions.</td></tr>
					 <tr><td>Visual</td><td>EK 3.1.3A Visualization tools and software can communicate information about data.</td><td>Reports a strings of zeros and ones is that correctly converts to binary from decimal (user input). </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Reports a strings of zeros and ones is that attempts to  convers to binary from decimal (user input). </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nothing is reported</td></tr>
					 <tr><td>Mathematics</td><td>EK 2.1.1G Numbers can be converted from any base to any other base. <br/> EK 4.1.1D Iteration is the repetition of part of an algorithm until a condition is met or for a specified number of times. <br/> EK 5.5.1A Numbers and numerical concepts are fundamental to programming.</td><td>Code uses a combination of mathematical concepts (floor, mod, etc) to calculate the binary numbers.  Mathematics is used to automate function calls. </td><td>Majority of the code uses a combination of mathematical concepts (floor, mod, etc) to calculate the binary numbers. Some hardcoded base cases are with in the math. Mathematics is used to automate function calls.</td><td>Some of the code uses a combination of mathematical concepts (floor, mod, etc) to calculate the binary numbers. Some hardcoded base cases are with in the math. Minimal mathematics is used to automate function calls.</td><td>Most of the code has hardcoded conversions from decimal to binary instead of calculating using operations, such as floor or mod. Function calls are not automated. </td><td>Uses no mathematics to monitor the loops. </td></tr>
					 <tr><td>Use of Parameters</td><td>EK 5.3.1G Parameters provide different values as input to procedures when they are called in a program.</td><td>Code blocks and abstract functions use parameters to increase usability and are easily changable for testing. Parameters allow user to input a number that is decimal (base 10).</td><td>Majority of abstractions utilize parameters to be used for testing. </td><td>Some functions and abstractions utilize parameters to allow greater functionality. </td><td>Few abstractions utilize parameters. </td><td>Abstractions do not utilize parameters. Do no use parameters from user input.</td></tr>
					 <tr><td>Style/Layout</td><td>EK 5.4.1A Program style can affect the determination of program correctness. <br/> EK 5.4.1B Duplicated code can make it harder to reason about a program.</td><td>Code cleanly organized and laid out to be read easily.  Abstractions/blocks are properly composed.</td><td>Much of the code is cleanly organized with certain parts disjointed/apart.</td><td>Half of the code is cleanly organized with the other half disjointed and separated.  </td><td>Majority of code is broken apart and hard to follow by the reader.</td><td>Code is laid out sporatically and cannot easily be followed by the reader/grader.</td><tr>
					 <tr><td>Naming</td><td>EK 5.4.1C Meaningful names for variables and procedures help people better understand programs. <br/>EK 5.1.2E Documentation about program components, such as blocks and procedures, helps in developing and maintaining programs.</td><td>Naming of functions, including abstractions, acurately represents the problem being solved.</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Some functions named properly, others provide no meaning.</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>All functions named improperly, not representing the problem at hand.</td></tr>
