								<h3>CS Education</h3>
								<p>(still under construction)
									My main focus in research is combining my passion for computer science, with my 
									passion in education. I do this through both designing and developing educational
									video games, in addition to teaching younger students about the cooler side of
									computer science (games, robotics, web, mobile apps etc.)</p>

								<h4>Journey/ Belonging (2013)</h4>
								<p>Journey and Belonging are two educational games sharing the same code for iOS that tell the story of Lebanese immigrants to North Carolina around the turn of the 20th century. They are part of a trio of educational games to be put in a Raleigh exhibit in February 2014. Journey is played by first selecting one of four playable characters from a village and Lebanon. Afterwards, the player will be presented with a scenario with a variety of factors in a graphic novel format, after which the player must choose between emigrating to America and staying in Lebanon. Each time the player stays in Lebanon he or she is presented with a new scenario based on historical events from the period. In this way, we hope to give the player an idea of how difficult the decision to emigrate was as well as the pressures on citizens of Lebanon around 1900.</p>
								
								<h4>Creation of a Digital Layer for Increased Museum Engagement (2012)</h4>
								<p>Museums can teach us many amazing historical facts in a very visual fashion. However, interactions with exhibits are typically very minimal, which makes it difficult to engage younger learners, especially those who have grown up in the digital age. Our research team created two interactive, web-based games for use in Discovery Place in Charlotte, NC that allowed teachers to create their own bank of questions relevant to their classroom curriculum that could be answered by the exhibits in the museum. Learners could log into the system and print out their own set of questions that they could find the answers to in the exhibits. After browsing the exhibits, the students could then submit their answers to the system and receive a score. This scavenger hunt style game served to increase student interaction with the exhibits. Our work was published and presented at the Games and Software Engineering Workshop, a part of the International Conference on Software Engineering, in Zurich, Switzerland in June 2012.</p>
								
								<h4>Snag'em (2011-2012)</h4>
								<p>Snag'em is a web-based human scavenger hunt.  In Snag'em players tag themselves
								with descriptors such as game developer, professor, ballroom dancer etc. Players are then
								given missions where they must find other players in real-life, introduce themselves, and 
								then "snag" them in a mission. </p>
								
								<h4>BOTS (2010)</h4>
   								<p>BOTS is a social collaboration-based game where players work together to solve puzzles
   								   using simple programming concepts. The game is played with a network of friends,
   								   using “code blocks” collected through mini-games, achievements, and social
   								   networking to build and share gadgets and solve puzzles. Aimed at an introductory
   								   computing audience, BOTS will help teach the concepts of computational thinking to
   								   students with no prior programming experience, and facilitate a social network for
   								   innovation and sharing of ideas between students and faculty.  </p>
